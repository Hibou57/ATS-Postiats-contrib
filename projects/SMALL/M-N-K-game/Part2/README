# Implementing M-N-K-game in ATS2

######

# Part2

######

I present in this part an implementation of M-N-K-game in the
coroutine style, where one routine implements the game logic and the
other GUI. It is primarily an experiment for evaluating this style
of programming.

######

This coroutine style of programming seems to be working as expected.

######

To compile, please just do 'make'. Then an excutable 'M-N-K-game is generated.
Please do './M-N-K-game to execute it.
