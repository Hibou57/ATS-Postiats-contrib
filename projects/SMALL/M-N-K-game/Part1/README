# Implementing M-N-K-game in ATS2
#

######
#
# Part1
#
######

I simply set things up in this part.

Part1/Makefile: for compiling the project:

Part1/game.sats:

At this point, I use [game.sats] to store all type definitions
and function declarations. This practice should work well for a small
project.

Part1/game.dats: This is the main file.

Part1/game_board.dats: for implementing the game-board.

Part1/game_config.dats: for handling game-configuration.
At this moment there are three global variables for storing the values of
M, N, and K.

Part1/game_initize.dats: for implementing game-initialization
Part1/game_finalize.dats for implementing game-finalization
Part1/game_mainloop.dats: for implementing the loop of playing the game

To compile, please just do 'make'. Then an excutable 'mygame' is generated.
Please do './mygame' to execute it. Of course, there is really not much to
see at this point.
