# Implementing M-N-K-game in ATS2

I give an implementation the M-N-K game in this part that uses some
primitive form of GTK-based GUI to collect inputs from players. This is
really a poor man's GUI. Obviously, collecting inputs in such a manner is
very awkward, and it clearly reveals a serious limitation of sequential
style of programming in the context of game implementation.

There are two common approaches to addressing this limitation:

(1) Using an event-driven style of programming that associates callback
    functions with GUI-events

(2) Using a coroutine-style of programming that cleanly separates the code
    for game logic from the code for GUI.

######

To compile, please just do 'make'. Then an excutable 'M-N-K-game is generated.
Please do './M-N-K-game to execute it.
