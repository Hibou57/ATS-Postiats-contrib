# Implementing M-N-K-game in ATS2

# Part1-2

######

I present in this part an implementation of M-N-K-game in the style
of sequential programming. Basically, any input from a player in this
implementation comes from the standard input channel (STDIN). Usually,
this style is chosen for a prototype implementation, making sure that the
underlying design actually works.

To compile, please just do 'make'. Then an excutable 'M-N-K-game is generated.
Please do './M-N-K-game to execute it.
