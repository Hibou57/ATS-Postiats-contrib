I simply set things up in this part.

Part1/Makefile: for compiling the project:

Part1/game.sats:

At this point, I use [game.sats] to store all type definitions
and function declarations. This practice should work well for a small
project.

Part1/game.dats: This is main file for the implementation

Part1/game_initize.dats: for implementing game-initialization
Part1/game_mainloop.dats: for implementing the loop of playing the game
Part1/game_finalize.dats for implementing game-finalization
