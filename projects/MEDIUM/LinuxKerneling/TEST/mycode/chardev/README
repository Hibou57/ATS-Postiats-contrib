###### beg of [README] ######

Assume that you are in THIS directory
(containing the README file).

Please issuing the following command-lines
to test chardev-1. Testing other chardev-?
is more or less the same.

######

# for building kernel modules
make

# for inserting module
sudo insmod ./chardev-1_dats.ko

# for the assigned major number:
sudo fgrep -i chardev /var/log/messages

# assume the major number is xyz
# create a char device for testing
sudo mknod /dev/chardev-1 c xyz 0

# so device is writable for anyone
sudo chmod 666 /dev/chardev-1

# read from device
cat /dev/chardev-1

# write to device
# (chardev-1 not supporting write)
# (but chardev-2 does support write)
echo "Hello" > /dev/chardev-1

# for removing device
sudo rm -f /dev/chardev-1

# for removing module
sudo rmmod chardev-1_dats
